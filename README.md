-  One of our team members is visually impared, so we always checked the accessibility of our website with a screen reader to make sure she could understand it.
-  We chose option b because we are international students from three different countries and we thought that it would be more interesting to work on an international restaurant website. We chose French cuisine because itâ€™s well known to many people and because there are not many French restaurants in Oslo.
